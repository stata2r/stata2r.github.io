# Translating Stata to R

Welcome. This website is for Stata users who are interested in learning R. We
provide side-by-side code snippets for common tasks in both Stata and R, so that
users have a dictionary for navigating across the two languages.

There are two main pages (✌️📄) on the site:

1. Data wrangling (🗄🧹) with [**data.table**](/data.table/)
2. Regression analysis (💻📈) with [**fixest**](/fixest/)

There are [**other great packages**](/extras/) that work well and are easy to
use, but **data.table** and **fixest** are blazingly fast (🏃🏻💨) and highly
powerful (💪🏻😎). Plus, they are flexible (👌✨) and can help you avoid R's
"package overload". Depending on what you do in Stata, you might even be able to
cut back, going from three packages—**reghdfe**, **estout** and **gtools**—to
just two.

See the icons in the top right corner for various site options. You can search
for keywords or commands, change the theme to light or dark mode to suit your
preferences, and go to the underlying [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/stata2r/stata2r.github.io) where all the source code is
located. Please let us know if you have suggestions or spot any errors.
